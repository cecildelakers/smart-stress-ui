# Smart Stress UI

Smart Stress UI is a Vite + React single-page application that prototypes a stress-monitoring console. It now supports both patient-facing and doctor-facing dashboards, each backed by configurable mock data so product teams can iterate on visuals and workflows before connecting real APIs.

---

## At a Glance
- React 18 with functional components and hooks
- Light, responsive UI built with plain CSS modules per component
- Mocked telemetry + survey data defined in `src/mockData.js`
- Optional Dify chat integration stubbed via `src/services/difyClient.js`
- Patient/Doctor tab switcher rendered entirely client-side

---

## Views

### Patient Dashboard
- Header shows patient demographics, care team, and last refresh timestamp.
- Detection panel combines a timeline chart (`TimelineChart.jsx`) with live signal cards and 24h/7d toggle.
- Explainability panel surfaces contextual guidance tied to the selected range.
- Chat panel replays scripted assistant responses; replace with real Dify calls when ready.
- Quick actions provide shortcuts to surveys, predictions, notes, and sample reports stored under `public/reports/`.

### Doctor Dashboard
- Overview cards summarize stress-level proportions, total monitored patients, and survey counts.
- HRV trend sparkline highlights cohort-level signal shifts.
- Patient table surfaces per-person vitals, program enrollment, stress indices, and survey recency (mocked data aligns with the patient view for Patient 1).
- CTA buttons prompt next steps for multidisciplinary teams.

## Getting Started

### Requirements
- Node.js 18 or higher
- npm 9+

### Installation
```bash
cd smart-stress-ui
npm install
npm run dev
```

The development server opens on `http://localhost:5173` (configure via Vite if needed).

---

## Available Scripts
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run dev` | Start Vite development server with hot reloading |
| `npm run build` | Create optimized production bundle in `dist/` |
| `npm run preview` | Serve the production build locally |

---

## Configuring Dify (Optional)
1. Duplicate `.env.example` (or create `.env`) with `VITE_DIFY_API_KEY=<your-key>`.
2. Replace the demo helpers in `src/services/difyClient.js` with the live Axios implementation (template included).
3. Update `ChatPanel.jsx` and `QuickActions.jsx` to import the real API helper functions.
4. Restart `npm run dev` and verify chat/quick-action requests return expected responses.

---

## Customizing Mock Data
All mock values—including patient vitals, time-series samples, doctor view totals, and action labels—live inside `src/mockData.js`. Update these objects to:
- Simulate different stress cohorts
- Align the doctor table with real program metadata
- Add alternate doctor actions or survey counts

Whenever you edit the generation logic (e.g., time series ranges), restart the dev server to view fresh data.

---

## Testing Checklist
- `npm run dev` renders both tabs without console errors.
- Toggle between patient and doctor tabs; verify data stays consistent for Patient 1.
- Switch the detection range between 24h and 7d and confirm charts/text update.
- Trigger each quick action and chat prompt to ensure UI states respond gracefully (mocked responses are synchronous).
- Run `npm run build` prior to deployment or sharing static previews.

---

## Notes
- Styling uses plain CSS files imported alongside components. Extend or replace them with Tailwind, MUI, etc., as your design system evolves.
- Chart rendering is handled by a lightweight SVG implementation for the doctor view and by Recharts in the patient timeline; swap in other charting libs if you prefer.
- Portions of this codebase originated from AI-assisted drafts—treat the mock data and client stubs as placeholders and audit before production use.
